## Mechanics
In Froggy Flower Hats, you put frogs onto tree stumps, wait for them to select which flower they want, and then drag the correct flower for the frog to wear on its head. Once you remove them from the stump, they will continue on with their day in fashion.

## Reflection
Froggy Flower Hats was inspired by Capybara Spa, a game by Cozy Bee Games about giving capybaras a spa day. I wanted to prove to myself that I would one day be capable of making something that could be published and sold. While this game is far removed from Capybara Spa in terms of quality and features, the features I did implement are polished and I understand them thoroughly.

This was my first time using enums as state managers. It was my first time building a game using a state manager mindset. Before implementing any graphics, I fully implemented the frog states so that it worked smoothly. This method of making games is definitely a smart one. Graphics can be motivating, but also frustrating if you try to make a pretty game and then the game doesn't function at all. It taught me the value of a functionality first approach.
